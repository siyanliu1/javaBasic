Short Answer:
Answer the following questions with complete sentences in your own words. You
are encouraged to conduct your own research online or through other methods
before answering the questions. If you research online, please consult multiple
sources before you write down your answers. You are expected to be able to
explain your answers in detail (Provide examples to each question).

1. What is Java variables and How to declare Java variables?
Java variables are containers used to store data values. They must be declared with a specific type before use. A variable declaration in Java follows this syntax:
int a = 0;

2. What are Java data types?
Java data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold. They are divided into:
Primitive Data Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
Non-Primitive Data Types: String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces.
 
3. What are Primitive data types in Java?
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

4. What is wrapper class in Java and Why we need wrapper class?
   
    A wrapper class in Java is a class that encapsulates a primitive data type inside an object. 
    Examples include Integer, Double, Character, Boolean.
    
    a. They provide utility methods, e.g., Integer.parseInt("123").
    
    b. Used in collections (List<Integer> instead of List<int>).
    
    c. Enable autoboxing (automatic conversion between primitives and objects).

5. What is the diﬀerences between passing by value and passing be reference?
   
    Pass by Value: A copy of the actual value is passed; changes inside the method do not affect the original value.

    Pass by Reference: A reference to the actual memory address is passed; changes inside the method affect the original object.

    Java always passes primitives by value and objects by reference (but the reference itself is passed by value).

    void changeValue(int a) {
        a = 10;
    }
    void changeObject(Person p) {
        p.name = "Alice";
    }

6. What is an Immutable class in Java?
An immutable class is a class whose objects cannot be modified after creation.
Example: String is immutable in Java.

7. How to create a custom immutable class in Java?
Declare the class as final
Make all fields private and final
Provide only getter methods
Do not provide setter methods
Use deep copies for mutable fields

Example:
final class Person {
    private final String name;
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}


8. What is String pool in Java and why we need String pool?
The String Pool is a special memory area in Java’s heap where string literals are stored to optimize memory usage.
Reduces memory usage.
Improves performance.

9. What are the results of following expressions? Please include the calculation process.
- 5 & 6, (AND)
5  ->  101
6  ->  110
4  ->  100 

- 5 | 6, (OR)
5  ->  101
6  ->  110
7  ->  111  

- 5 ^ 6, (XOR)
5  ->  101
6  ->  110
3  ->  011


10. Why we need to use break statement in Switch statement?
Without break, execution falls through to the next case. The break statement ensures the program exits the switch block after executing a case.

11.  What are access modifiers and their corresponding scopes in Java?
public: Accessible from anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the same class.
protected: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
default (no modifier): Accessible within the same package.

12.  What is static field and static method?
A static field belongs to the class rather than an instance.
A static method can be called without creating an object.

13.   Explain the main method in Java.
The main method is the entry point of any Java application. 
public: Accessible from anywhere.
static: No need to create an object to run.
void: Does not return a value.
String[] args: Command-line arguments.

Coding Questions:
Write code in Java to solve following problems. Please write your
own answers. You are highly encouraged to present more than one way to answer
the questions. Please follow best practice when you write the code so that it would
be easily readable, maintainable, and eﬃcient. Clearly state your assumptions if you
have any. You may discuss with others on the questions, but please write your own
code.
1. Develop a mathematical Calculator
a. (2 Variables -- X=5,Y=7) -->> Add, Sub, Mul, Div
b. (3 Variables -- X=5,Y=6,Z=7) -->> Add, Sub, Mul, Div
The input contains two array, an array of variables and an array of operators:
input1 = [5,6,14,7], input2 = [“Add”, “Sub”, “Div”]
The precedence of operator needs to be taken care of, for example, the above example should
be 5 + 6 - (14 / 7) = 9 instead of (5 + 6 - 14) / 7 = 0 (if the end result is not integer, output the
floor of the decimal result)
Assumption:
1. No parentheses
2. Input will always be valid
3. input2.length = input1.length - 1
4. Write a Java program to convert minutes into a number of years and days.
Test Data
Input the number of minutes: 3456789
Expected Output :
3456789 minutes is approximately 6 years and 210 days
1. Using only the programming techniques you learned in this lesson, write an application that
calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 10 and prints the resulting values in
table format, as shown below. (Build-in functions are not acceptable)
number square cube
0 0 0
1 1 1
2 4 8
.
.
10 100 1000
1. (Print a table) Write a program that displays the following table:
a b pow(a, b)
1 2 1
2 3 8
3 4 81
4 5 1024
5 6 15625
5.(Occurrence of max numbers) Write a program that reads integers, finds the
largest of them, and counts its occurrences. Assume that the input ends with
number 0. Suppose that you entered 3 5 2 5 5 5 0; the program finds that the
largest is 5 and the occurrence count for 5 is 4.
Enter numbers: 3 5 2 5 5 5 0
The largest number is 5
The occurrence count of the largest number is 4
1. Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one.
Find that single one. Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and
without using extra memory?(Hint: xor)
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
1. PrintNumberInWord (nested-if, switch-case):
Write a program called PrintNumberInWord which prints "ONE", "TWO",... , "NINE", "OTHER" if
the int variable "number" is 1, 2,... , 9, or other, respectively.
Use (a) a "nested-if" statement; (b) a "switch-case" statement.
1. Create your own int wrapper class.
Hint: What are the fields, constructor and which method should your wrapper class
include(intValue(), shortValue(), equals() etc. ).
