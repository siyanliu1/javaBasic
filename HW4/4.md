### 1. What is a Thread and What is a Process? What are the Differences?  
A **process** is an independent program in execution that has its own memory and resources. A **thread** is a lightweight unit of execution within a process that shares the process’s memory and resources.  

#### Key Differences:  
- A process is independent, while threads within a process share memory.  
- Switching between processes is slower because each has its own memory space, whereas switching between threads is faster.  
- If one process crashes, it does not affect others, but if a thread crashes, it may impact other threads in the same process.  

### 2. How to Create Threads in Java?  
There are two main ways to create a thread in Java:  
1. Extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method.  
2. Implementing the `Runnable` interface and passing it to a `Thread` object.  

The second approach is generally preferred as it allows more flexibility, such as extending other classes.  

### 3. Runnable or Thread, Which is Preferred and Why?  
Using the `Runnable` interface is preferred because:  
- It allows a class to extend another class, since Java does not support multiple inheritance.  
- It separates the task definition from the execution, making the code more reusable.  
- It is more suitable for thread pooling, where the same object can be executed by multiple threads.  

### 4. What are the Differences Between `start()` and `run()`?  
- `start()` creates a new thread and runs the `run()` method inside that new thread.  
- `run()` does not create a new thread; it executes like a normal method in the same thread.  

Using `run()` directly does not achieve multithreading, so `start()` should be used to actually create a new thread.  

### 5. What Happens if `start()` is Called Twice? What About `run()`?  
- Calling `start()` twice on the same thread object results in an exception because a thread cannot be restarted once started.  
- Calling `run()` multiple times does not cause an error, but it does not create a new thread. Instead, it executes sequentially in the same thread.  

### 6. What is the Thread Life Cycle in Java?  
A thread goes through different states during its execution:  
1. **New** – The thread is created but has not started.  
2. **Runnable** – The thread is ready to run but is waiting for CPU time.  
3. **Running** – The thread is currently executing its task.  
4. **Blocked** – The thread is waiting for a resource that another thread holds.  
5. **Waiting** – The thread is paused indefinitely until another thread signals it.  
6. **Timed Waiting** – The thread is paused for a specific duration and then resumes.  
7. **Terminated** – The thread has finished execution or was stopped.  

### 7. What is the `join()` Method in Java?  
The `join()` method ensures that one thread waits until another finishes execution before continuing. This is useful when a task needs to be completed before proceeding with the next step.  

### 8. What is the Difference Between `sleep()` and `wait()`?  
- `sleep()` pauses a thread for a specific time but does not release any locks it holds.  
- `wait()` pauses a thread indefinitely and releases locks, allowing other threads to access shared resources before the thread resumes.  

### 9. What is a Daemon Thread in Java? Why is it Needed?  
A **Daemon thread** is a low-priority background thread that runs continuously until all user threads have finished. It is used for background tasks like garbage collection.  

Daemon threads ensure that non-essential tasks do not prevent the program from exiting when all important tasks are done.  

### 10. What is Thread Interference? Give an Example.  
Thread interference occurs when multiple threads try to modify shared data at the same time, leading to inconsistent results.  

For example, if two threads increase a counter at the same time, they may overwrite each other’s changes, resulting in a wrong final count. This is called a **race condition** and can be avoided using synchronization techniques.  

### 11. What are Some Ways to Perform Thread Synchronization?  
To prevent multiple threads from interfering with each other, synchronization techniques include:  
- Using the `synchronized` keyword to ensure only one thread can access a resource at a time.  
- Using `ReentrantLock` for more advanced locking control.  
- Using `volatile` to ensure visibility of shared variables across threads.  
- Using atomic variables like `AtomicInteger` to perform thread-safe operations.  

### 12. What is Deadlock? How to Resolve It?  
A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are waiting for resources that are locked by each other, preventing them from proceeding.  

To prevent deadlocks:  
- Avoid holding multiple locks at the same time.  
- Follow a strict order when acquiring locks to avoid circular dependency.  
- Use timeout mechanisms while acquiring locks to prevent indefinite waiting.  

### 13. What is the Difference Between `SynchronizedMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap`?  
- `SynchronizedMap` locks the entire map, meaning only one thread can modify it at a time, leading to poor performance in high-concurrency situations.  
- `ConcurrentHashMap` divides the map into segments, allowing multiple threads to modify different parts simultaneously, making it more efficient.  

### 14. What is a Singleton Class?  
A Singleton class is a class that allows only one instance to exist throughout the application.  

It is used when a single point of access is needed, such as for database connections, logging systems, or configuration managers. A properly implemented Singleton ensures thread safety and prevents multiple instances from being created accidentally.
