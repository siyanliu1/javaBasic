1. What is an Object in Java and why do we need objects?

    In Java, an object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior. Objects are fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP) as they allow developers to model real-world entities. 
    
    For example, a Car class can have objects like car1 and car2, each with its own attributes (e.g., color, model) and methods (e.g., drive, brake). This approach promotes modularity, code reusability, and a clear structure. 

2. What is Inheritance and how many types of inheritance are supported by Java?

    Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one class (subclass or child class) acquires the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or parent class). 

    This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. 

    Java supports single inheritance (a class inherits from one superclass) and multilevel inheritance (a class inherits from a superclass, which in turn inherits from another superclass). 

    However, Java does not support multiple inheritance (a class inheriting from multiple superclasses) to avoid complexity and ambiguity. 

3. What is the diamond problem in Java? And how can we resolve the problem?

    The diamond problem happens when a class inherits from two classes that both inherited from a common parent. 
    
    This creates confusion—if both parent classes have the same method, which one should the child class use? Java avoids this by not allowing multiple inheritance of classes. 
    
    Instead, it uses interfaces, and if two interfaces have the same default method, the child class has to override it to clear up any conflicts.

4. What’s the difference between an Interface and an Abstract Class?
   
    An interface is like a contract, it only defines method names (without actual implementations) that any implementing class must follow. An abstract class is a bit more flexible; it can have both abstract methods (ones without bodies) and concrete methods (ones with actual code).

    If you need multiple inheritance, go for interfaces (since Java lets a class implement multiple interfaces).

    If you want some shared functionality along with abstract methods, use an abstract class.

5. What is Polymorphism, and how does Java use it?
   
    Polymorphism means "many forms"—it lets the same code work differently depending on the object. 

    Java supports method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (a subclass provides its own version of a method from the parent class). This makes programs more flexible and dynamic.


6. What’s the difference between method overriding and overloading?

    Overriding happens in inheritance, a child class redefines a method from its parent class.
Overloading happens in the same class—you create multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

    Overriding is for runtime behavior, while overloading is decided at compile time.

7. What is Encapsulation, and why do we need it?
    Encapsulation is like putting data in a protective bottle. We make variables private and only allow access through getter and setter methods. 

    This prevents unwanted modifications and keeps things secure. It also makes debugging easier since everything is controlled through specific methods.

8. How is abstraction different from encapsulation?

    Abstraction hides unnecessary details—like a car's engine, you just know how to drive without worrying about how it works.

    Encapsulation hides data and restricts direct access—like locking the hood of your car so nobody messes with the engine.

    Both improve security and make code more maintainable.

9. What is toString() and why do we use it?
    
    toString() is a method that gives a string version of an object. If you print an object without overriding toString(), you’ll see something like Car@3c5a99. 

    But if you override it, you can return useful info, like "Car: Honda, Color: Red". This is great for debugging and logging.

10. Can we use this in a constructor? Why?
    
    Yes! this refers to the current object. In a constructor, it's useful for setting instance variables when they have the same name as parameters. 

    You can also use this() to call another constructor in the same class, which helps avoid duplicate code.
